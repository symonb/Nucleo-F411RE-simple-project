The final version of the project, described on my blog, in the post "How to develop STM32 with VScode? part 2/2" [drone blog](https://symonbielenin.blogspot.com/).
It is a simple project with a structure that can be used for any project. HAL library is also added and on the blog, there is a description of how to adjust all files for your own MCU.
Feel free to copy any part you need.
